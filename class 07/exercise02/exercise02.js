// # Exercise #2: Intermediate

// Closures are functions that remember their lexical environments. Lexical environments mean the environment in which the function was declared.

// ******************************************************************

//     function parent(x) {
//     return function closure() {
//         // Closure is declared here.
//         return x;
//     };
//     }

//     const remember = parent("remembers me");
//     // Seems like the variable x would be gone after
//     // parent is executed, but it's not.

//     closure();
//     // Return "remembers me"


// ******************************************************************
    
// **Aim:** Fix the code to correctly implement the callback.


    function parent(x) {
    return function closure() {
        // Closure is declared here.
       return x;
    };
    }

    const remember = parent("remembers me");
    // Seems like the variable x would be gone after
    // parent is executed, but it's not.

    remember();
